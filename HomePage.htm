    Computer security also known as Cybersecurity is the body of technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. In a computing context, security includes both cybersecurity and physical security.

         <h3>Why is Computer security needed?</h3>
         <p>Computer security is the process of preventing and detecting unauthorized use of your computer. Prevention measures help you stop unauthorized users (hackers) from accessing any part of your computer system. Detection helps you to determine whether or not someone attempted to break into your system, if they were successful, and what they may have done.</p>
         <p>Too often, computer and network security is not thought about until a problem arises. At this point, a breach in security can cause huge and potentially harmful problems to your business and&frasl;;or your customers. By setting up a security plan and an emergency action plan, you can know that the information held in your computers and networks is safe and secure.</p>

         <h3>Common Computer Security threats</h3>
         <ol>
             <li><h4>Computer Virus Threats</h4><p>A computer virus is a program written to alter the way a computer operates, without the permission or knowledge of the user. A virus replicates and executes itself, usually doing damage to your computer in the process.</p>
             </li>
             <li><h4>Spyware Threats</h4>spyware is any program that monitors your online activities or installs programs without your consent for profit or to capture personal information.</li>
              <li><h4>Hackers &amp; Predators</h4>Hackers and predators are programmers who victimize others for their own gain by breaking into computer systems to steal, change or destroy information as a form of cyber-terrorism. </li>
              <li><h4>Phishing Threats</h4>Masquerading as a trustworthy person or business, phishers attempt to steal sensitive financial or personal information through fraudulent email or instant messages.</li>
  </ol>

         <h3>Ways to prevent Computer security threats</h3>
         <ol>
             <li><h4>Install Anti-Virus Software</h4>Ensure that reputable anti-virus software is installed on all computers. This should include all servers, PCs and laptops. If employees use computers at home for business use or to remotely access the network, these PCs should also have anti-virus software installed.</li>
             <li><h4>Ensure that the anti-virus software is up to date</h4>Everyday new computer viruses are being released and it is essential that businesses are protected from these viruses by keeping the anti-virus software up to date. If possible, companies should look at policies whereby computers that do not have the most up to date anti-virus software installed are not allowed to connect to the network.</li>
             <li><h4>Filter all email traffic</h4>All incoming and outgoing email should be filtered for computer viruses. This filter should ideally be at the perimeter of the network to prevent computer viruses. Emails with certain file attachments commonly used by computer viruses to spread themselves, such as .EXE, .COM and .SCR files, should also be prevented from entering the network.</li>
             <li><h4>Scan Internet Downloads</h4>Ensure that all files downloaded from the Internet are scanned for computer viruses before being used. Ideally this scanning should be done from one central point on the network to ensure that all files are properly scanned.</li>
